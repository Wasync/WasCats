# Wanted

A small game to lay the foundation of the new SLDX

# Overview

I had been in the process of making an SDL2wrapper for some time. Having mostly compeleted it, and having learned a lot in the process, I decided that it was no longer adequate, and so I am remaking it.

This project is to be the foundation of it all. It will of course take some elements from my [old SDLX](https://github.com/FlavorlessQuark/old_SDL_Tools).
At the end of it I hope to have build the following:
  - Init
  - Simple game loop
  - Simple render engine, with layers
  - Simple mouse interaction and hitbox
  - Timer (game should record *real* time elapsed between frames
  - Fps cap
  - Simple draw text
  - For added challenge, it shoudl handle resizing

## Concept

The conceptis simple and inspired from Mario 64's Wanted minigame. One person is wanted, find them in the crowd. I picked this one because it allows meto code for and solve a layering problem (which image to display first?) and is simple enough to let building SDLX be the main focus

## Testing the limits

However "easy" this project seems, it is also a test of my abilities, as are all the projects in this organization. How fast and how well can I code this... How hard will it actually be? The clock starts.... Now!
